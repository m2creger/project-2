Home awesomeness is a web app for homeowners to put ideas together for their house. This web app allows users to save their ideas to their own account, make budgets for the potential project, find contractors on yelp. If they want to do the project themselves, they can put together a list of materials and costs. They can look up on flickr pictures to get ideas and save these pics under the potential project.

The technologies used in this project are node js, mongoose, mongo, heroku, node request, passport.

The challenges presented were to put projects under the authorized user and then edit these projects.
